# WordPress Advanced Search with Search Filters using Custom Taxonomies and Custom Fields

**An example of how my [Custom Search WordPress Plugin](https://github.com/nuancedesignstudio/nds-advanced-search) can be used to add `Search Filters` using `Custom Taxonomies` and `Custom fields`.**

_The intent is to help developers with a boilerplate search plugin with search suggestions that can be customized for advanced scenarios._

## Description

* The base plugin available at: https://github.com/nuancedesignstudio/nds-advanced-search.
* Refer the files in this repo to see how you can add custom search filters to your search.

## Developer Notes

* Custom Fields were added using the premium version of [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/). The acf-json is available in the `import-acf-cpt` folder.
* CPTs and Taxonomies were added using the free version of the [Custom Post Type UI plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/) by WebDevStudios. Use the cpt-json and cpt-taxonomies JSON files to import them.
* Uses [jQuery Colorbox](https://github.com/jackmoore/colorbox) to load the popup.
